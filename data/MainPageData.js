    { title: "MISSION STATEMENT",
     text: "When working on a film during the summer break between my second and third year of university, a wireless focus rig that we were using on set simply stopped working. The immediate upheaval of stress and anxiety became palpable on set as we struggled to find a rental house that worked for us. The 1st camera assistant (AC), who was using the wireless focus rig, was obliged to rely on skill and manually executed the remainder of the shots for the day. Watching the havoc caused by the broken equipment, I started to feel nervous about breaking into the industry after university. I soon realized that there was a gap in resources for recently graduated film industry newcomers. Wanting to fill this gap, I created FilmlancersLDN.com with the goal of synthesizing information and resources for renting kit and equipment. Please read our ‘How It Works’ article below to learn about our process!"},

     {title: "HOW IT WORKS",
     text: `After clicking the ‘Start Renting Here’ button you will find a list of departments, once choosing your desired departments you will be taken to a page with listed rental houses. Each rental house will display the location, reviews and a link to the rental house's respective home pages. These are the next steps after choosing a rental house:  
     \nImportant Notice (Legal Information Included):`,
     subtitle1: "PRE-HIRE",
     olist:["Provide the rental house with a list of what you want to rent (rental list)",
     "Receive a quote from the rental house",
     `The rental house will then request:\n
      ●     ‘Hired-in’ this is equipment insurance to the replacement value of the kit in the case that it is damaged or destroyed. It is essential to include the dates of when the kit is being used, whether the kit is in active use, storage, transport, and so on.
      ●    Photo ID (passport, driving license etc.)
      ●    Complete account application form (some rental houses do not ask for an account application form) \n\n`,
     "After this, the rental house will send you a confirmation of the quote",
     "You will then make the payment in full (some rental houses will add proceeding payments from future renting to a created account)", 
     "Confirmation will then be sent from the rental house to ensure that all requested details are in order",
     "Kit can then be collected/delivered at a specified time and date (Please note: It is normal to collect/deliver kit in the afternoon on the day before the shoot, and to return kit the morning after wrapping.)"], 
     subtitle2:"\nPOST-HIRE",
     ulist:["Kit should always be returned in good condition. If the kit needs to be cleaned, if it is damaged or missing, charges will apply. This can be difficult to navigate if the shoot is low budget, so do be aware of proper kit maintenance.", 
     " The rental house often charges for ‘consumables used’ after the kit is checked in by technicians at the rental house. This is only done when renting perishable items that knowingly need replacing after use; for example, poly, colour gels, tapes etc.",
     "An invoice will be issued, if applicable, for any cleaning charges or consumables used. (This can be added on to the original job sheet if it is not a first time hire.) Please Note: This is a general list and is subject to change depending on the rental house."],

    {title:"TIPS N' TRICKS FOR RENTING",
    text: "This is a list of tips and tricks, gathered through interviews with rental houses, on suggestions for novice renters. Read the section below to master the nuances of renting:",
    ulist: ["If you mix kit from rental houses on one rig it can shut the whole system down. Rental houses will test the system before it leaves the rental house, to ensure every component works together. Adding new components to that system can cause potential issues when shooting. ",
    "During different parts of the year, rental houses will have different amounts of kit available. It is better to rent kit during school holidays as rental houses tend to have more kit available during that time. You will additionally have a higher chance of getting a better deal during these times.",
    "Some rental houses will only charge for one day when kit/equipment is rented over a weekend, meaning that the weekend can be the cheapest time to do a short shoot. ",
    "If you are looking to get a good deal from a rental house (primarily on a low budget project), it is best to clearly express willingness to adapt your kit list to the rental houses’ availability. ",
    "If you have been given a discount, make sure to pick up the kit rather than having the rental house drop it off, as they are more likely to give deals to people who are willing to pick kit/equipment up.",
    "If rental houses support you on low-budget projects it is highly valued to return to the rental house when you are capable of paying full rates.", 
    "It is important to build a relationship with a rental house: like any symbiotic relationship, everyone involved will be happier if loyalty is shown.", 
    "As a part of building a relationship with a rental house, we highlight the importance of returning kit/equipment in good condition, on time, and with grace."]
